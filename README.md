COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
Description:
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a data analysis and reporting tool built in Python, aimed at tracking global COVID-19 trends. The project analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time, providing insights through visualizations. The objective is to track how the pandemic progressed and to examine vaccination rollouts and trends in various countries.

Objectives
Import and clean global COVID-19 data.

Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

Compare key metrics across countries and regions.

Visualize trends through charts, line graphs, and maps.

Present the findings in a Jupyter Notebook with narrative insights.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib – for data visualization

Seaborn – for statistical data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – for interactive code execution and report generation

Insights & Reflections
The analysis of global COVID-19 trends reveals how different countries handled the pandemic, with notable disparities in vaccination rollouts, case numbers, and death rates.

India's second wave stands out as an anomaly, with a significant surge in both cases and deaths during mid-2021. In contrast, Kenya had a slower increase in cases and deaths, reflecting different public health responses and available resources.

Vaccination efforts were the most effective tool in reducing death rates, with countries like the USA and India leading in vaccination coverage, although there is still much work to be done in Kenya and other low-income countries.

The project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in understanding global health crises and in crafting effective public health responses.
