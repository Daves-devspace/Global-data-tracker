# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** project analyzes global COVID-19 trends over time. This project processes real-world data, focusing on key metrics such as total cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries. The project aims to provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic's impact and the progress of vaccination rollouts across the globe.

## Project Objectives
- Import and clean global COVID-19 data.
- Analyze and explore trends over time for cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across different countries and regions.
- Visualize data using charts and maps to highlight important trends.
- Generate actionable insights and communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization (line charts, bar charts, etc.).
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization (heatmaps, trend plots).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive notebook environment for coding and documentation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling missing values.

Insights and Reflections
Vaccination Rollout: India had the fastest vaccination rollout, while Kenya faced logistical challenges, slowing down its progress.

Death Rates: The death rate decreased significantly in countries like the USA and India after the introduction of vaccines, showing the positive effect of vaccination.

Second Wave Anomaly: India experienced a significant spike in cases and deaths during the second wave, highlighting the urgency for better healthcare infrastructure during pandemics.

Global Comparison: The USA and India have the highest vaccination coverage, while African countries, like Kenya, have slower vaccination rates, indicating the need for better vaccine distribution networks in low-resource settings.

Reflections
This project provided valuable insights into global COVID-19 trends and the critical role of vaccination in reducing the spread and death rate. Data analysis and visualization help to highlight the disparities between countries and the urgency of equitable vaccine distribution. This project emphasizes the importance of data in understanding global health crises.
